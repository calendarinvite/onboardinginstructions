667c47139f1b825347e0ff86,Manual SAM Delivery Readiness without GIT,https://trello.com/c/hHet33II/103-manual-sam-delivery-readiness-without-git,"From Greg:

So, this is a readiness test.  To sell our first deals manually without GIT.  We would only need the private repo URL for the packages when they are sold from you and JJ.   Customer Workflow -   They pay first for the server edition. $995. Via Stripe.  They get an email with a notification that it is automated, telling them I will send them a notification with a private URL to pick up the SAM templates and VUE.JS packages.   I will send Erica a notification via email that customer X has paid.  Erica sends me a private link for customers to download in SAM repo for now.  In the repo is the SAM Template and Arnie's VUE Cal snack package + SIS Admin Package.   The repo can be a S3 / or a Drop Box with a one time link to get to the template.   No across account setup. This is a package SAM template sale.    So we are responsible for declaring how to ""set it up"" in line in the template and a small doc with what resources are provisioning for them in their account.  I send the private link out and copy the team.   We then can work on GitRepo over the back half of the year.   It will take time to build revenue with the button up but feel good about the manual hop for now.   That means they would get the total template with access to Lambas as they stand with a PDF on how it all works.   Customers would be responsible for all AWS setup, connections , and our ideal target is an experienced AWS account owner with a SES account.    We will cover this in the Stripe Button under buyer beware.   I will have all API docs completed in 2 weeks, along with samples of how we built calendar snack screenshots in the current revision.   Please advise if you have any red flags regarding this approach.   It all seems solid on workflow.  And we can always refund the money .   This is a great recent from AWS on Step Functions and a Detailed repo.
